# CISC 352 AI PROJECT

## COURSE SCHEDULING ASSISTANT

This project aims to develop an AI-driven system to enhance Queen's Universityâ€™s course scheduling and student advising processes. The system integrates three key components:

1. CSP-Based Room Assignment Module:Utilizes constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) techniques to optimize room scheduling under multiple constraints:
   * No room can be assigned to overlapping time slots
   * No same department, same year courses can overlap
   * Professor preferences
   * Etc.
2. Probabilistic Inference Model:Predicts student success in courses based on various performance metrics (to be implemented later).
3. Deep Learning Course Search Engine:Interprets natural language queries to provide personalized course recommendations.

## Constrain Satisfaction Problem

To run the csp make sure you are in the 352-Course-Project directory, And run the FinalCSP.py file.
