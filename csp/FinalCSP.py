Course Scheduling CSP 
This script loads data from CSV files and uses it with the constraint satisfaction
problem solver to generate a course schedule.
It uses pops open a display to see the output as it doesn't all fit in the terminal 

Full Shedule: Shows how all courses are scheduled
Day of the Week: Shows each course that is scehduled for that respective day
Hypothetical Schedule: Randomly picks 3 courses from the same program, and 2 others all from
the same year to simulate what a students schedule may look like based on the CSP
- This sometimes will say "Not enough classes" this means that it is trying to find 3 classes 
for the same course code for the same year which with the random sampling of courses sometimes does
not exists, so just go back to another tab in the drop down and try again and it will generate a new 
hypothetical schedule each time you do this.
