Research questions may include basic science queries based in human anatomy, and questions related to teaching and learning in the Anatomical Sciences. In small groups, students will develop and carry out comprehensive research objectives, and draft a complete manuscript of the summative work intended for publication in a peer-reviewed academic journal. Using the skills previously gained in ANAT 391, students will also produce a high-quality prosected human anatomical specimen. The goal of prosection is to dissect a specimen in a stepwise manner aimed at teaching the dissected structures. To develop proficiencies in online anatomical education and communicating complex anatomical concepts, students will be expected to use audio and visual elements to create a presentation highlighting the key features of their respective specimens. Students will participate in self-reflection and peer feedback to think critically about their skills in anatomical research and pedagogy. The advancement of the relevant competences will facilitate professional development. The course has various types of assessments including a practical dissected specimen and accompanying presentation video, thoughtful reflection and peer feedback, and a summative research manuscript. Students will have the opportunity to develop a research question with their teams and complete research objectives in a comprehensive and thoughtful manner, mentored by the course instructors.","Prerequisite Level 4 or above and registration in a LISC Major or Specialization, or BHSc Program, and a minimum grade of A- in ANAT 391/3.0.
